## Development notes

#### What went well?

    - Collection Views documentation on Apple's website is very detailed and good.
    - Multiple layouts are easier to do than SwiftUI in comparison in my opinion.
    

#### What could be better?

    - Making the connection view between Data Source a little eaiser compared to SwiftUI.
    - Remembering to include all three elments of a collection view ðŸ˜‚
